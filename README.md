A1. Write your own module for detecting the feature/attributefor the root note of a Decision Tree. Use Information gain as the impurity measure for identifying the root node. Assume that the features are categoricalor could be converted to categorical by binning.

A2. If the feature is continuous valued for A1, use equal widthor frequencybinning for converting the attribute to categorical valued.The binning type should be aparameter to the function built for binning. Write your own function for the binning task.The number of bins to be created should also be passed as aparameter to the function. Use function overloadingtoallow for usage of default parameters if no parameters are passed.

A3. Expand the above functions to built your own Decision Tree module.
